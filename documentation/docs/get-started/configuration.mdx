Actually our system have implement multiple app models. So we can implement more apps in a different package and other model.
in this project we have 3 different apps. So we have 3 different env files. You can check the `env folder` in the `root directory`.

Actually we call the app as `brand1`. `brand1` is a product type of our system. currently we only implement single app in this project.

But you can implement different type of apps in this project. [Reference](/docs/multiple-apps).

# Configuration Brand Name

So you can change the brand name , enter the brand name in the input field below.

<AppBrandInputBrand />

# Configuration Environment Files

The `env` directory contains configuration files for running the app in
different environments.

Each file within represents the environment:

<Env />

:::note
The env configuration is already added in this project. You can check the env folder.
