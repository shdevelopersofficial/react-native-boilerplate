# Configuration

import Android from "./android.mdx";
import IOS from "./ios.mdx";
import Animation from "@site/src/components/Animation";
import AppBrandInputBrand from "@site/src/components/AppBrand/InputBrand";
import Env from "@site/src/components/CodeBlock/Env";

Our system is providing to implement multiple apps in a single codebase. So we can implement multiple apps in a different package and other model. Easy to maintain codebase and well structured.

- Example

  - Food Delivery App
  - FoodApp need delivery app , Shop app , Customer app , Driver app , Admin app. So here we can implement all apps in a single codebase.
  - Actually our project is configured with 2 brands. that is 'brand1' and 'brand2'.
  - If you want to implement more brands, you can add more brands , otherwise only 1 brand is enough.

So you can add the brand name , enter the brand name in the input field below.

<AppBrandInputBrand />

# Configuration Environment Files

different environments.

Each file within represents the environment:

```bash
env

└── brand2
    ├── dev
    ├── live
