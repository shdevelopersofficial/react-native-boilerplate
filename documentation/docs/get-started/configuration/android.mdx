This is the documentation of android configuration and multiple app setup.

import Appname from "@site/src/components/Appname/Appname";

##

## Current Status

- Current AppName is <Appname background={true} /> and application id is <Appname packageName={true} background={true} />
- Also you can see `brand1` and `brand2` in more places.it is a multiple app
  system.

## Apk Build , App Start and Bundle

Actually we implemented multiple script for start,build apk and bundle release
in android. it can easy to multiple apk in different [environment](config.md).

- Check package.json file you can see multiple scripts.
- Also our system can develop multiple app in a single code system.
- In this code base we added 2 app system. the app name has `brand1` and
  `brand2`.
- you can change app name in `brand1` and `brand2` based on your project.

## Steps

1. First goto `android/app/build.gradle`

```bash
flavorDimensions 'branding'
    productFlavors {
        brand1 {
            dimension 'branding'
        }
        brand2 {
            dimension 'branding'
        }
    }
```

- You can change `brand1` and `brand2`.

- in our system we are using brand1 is default android configuration. so android
  configuration is existing brand1 `src/main`.

- brand2 android configuration is available another folder `src/brand2`.

2. Goto env file and env folder in root folder.

```bash
root
  env
    ├── brand1
    │   ├── dev
    │   ├── live
    │   └── prod
    └── brand2
        ├── dev
        ├── live
        └── prod
.env
```

- Here you can change all folder brand1 and brand2. and Update this
  [documentation](config.md) also for better purpose.
- Update env file details lilke `RN_APP_ID , RN_APP_NAME , RN_APP_BRAND` .etc

3. Goto Package.json , you can see more scripts in this file.

- Example

```bash
"_start_android_brand1": "npm run android -- --mode=brand1Debug --appId=com.xcule",
"_build_android_brand1": "npm run _build_android -- assembleBrand1Release",
"_bundle_android": "npm run _build_android -- bundleBrand1Live",
```

- The above example , you can see script name and scripts we added `brand1` and
  `brand2`. you can just replace your `brand1` and `brand2`.

**Note:** Some place you can see `Brand1` and `brand1` uppercase and lowercase.
keep format like that.

- Also you can update script [documentation](scripts.md) for feature developer
  purpose.

4. Goto `app/screens` , you can see the brandOne and brandTwo folders

- You can change brandOne and brandTwo name.

5. Goto `app/navigators` , you can see the brandOne and brandTwo folders

- You can change brandOne and brandTwo name.
