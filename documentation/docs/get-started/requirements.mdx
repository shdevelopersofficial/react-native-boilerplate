# Requirements {#requirements}

We recommend the `classic` template so that you can get started quickly, and it contains features found in Docusaurus 1. The `classic` template contains `@docusaurus/preset-classic` which includes standard documentation, a blog, custom pages, and a CSS framework (with dark mode support). You can get up and running extremely quickly with the classic template and customize things later on when you have gained more familiarity with Docusaurus.

# Getting Started

- Set up your development environment by following the
  [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

- Install the correct version of CocoaPods by installing
  [podenv](https://github.com/kylef-archive/podenv) and running
  `npm run install:pod`.

- Install the correct version of node.js by installing
  [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and running `nvm install` in the
  project root.

- Install the correct version of npm by running `npm run install:npm`.

- Install the node modules by running `npm install` and wait for everything to
  be built successfully.
