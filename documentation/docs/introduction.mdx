# Introduction

⚡️ React native boilerplate is a boilerplate for React Native apps with batteries included. It is based on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

💥 Mainly we are focusing the boilerplate to easy to use , secure and scalable.

🌩️ We provide well documentation and easy to understand.

🏗️ We are inviting you to contribute to this project and make it better for feature releases.

## Features {#features}

🤖 This boilerplate comes with the following features:

#### Basics

💪 Project is working mainly `Typescript`. Also support `JavaScript`.

🤖 This project is developed `android` , `iOS` and `Web`.

📦 Project code is configured with `eslint` and `Prettier`. So we dont thing
about code style and code quality. the system is managed more cases. we can
get more error in vscode or codebase. We can easy to understand and rectify
the problem.

🧪 Example

    import file is automatically ordered alphabetically.
    we can see unwanted variable or imported file easily.
    typescript format is mandatory.
    filename is kebab case format.

🛠️ You can develop multiple app/brands in a single codebase.

Example :-

    We are planning to develop `foodApp`. we need to develop basically need 3 apps
    (FoodApp UserApp , Delivery App and Shop Admin App).
    So in this codebase we can develop all system in a single codebase. using `Android favors` and `iOS schemes`.

🎬 build multiple release like `development` , `production` and `live`.

🔆 Support `Dark Mode`.

🧰 `Fonts Family (Poppins)` Support. You can just change new fonts
`app/assets/fonts` and change fonts name in `app/styles/fonts` and run this
script `npx react-native-asset`.

🛀 We can access other file directly. Old code system we use
`import { fontSize, fontStyle } from '../../styles/fonts'` , but this project
we can use file path directly
`import { fontSize, fontStyle } from 'app/styles/fonts'` , So we don't think
about path issue.

- `Context` added.
- `Hermes` enabled for reduce app size and improve app performance.
- `renovate` is added. it is automatically manage dependencies and automatically
  check dependencies version weekly and create merge request is git.
- Project `documentation` is added.
- `Unit test` is added.
- `Navigation` is configured.
- Major feature is `we cant push to git` code without manage
  `eslint coding style`. So it can improve app performance. we can
  `reduce code review time` for code structure and `improve code quality`.
- `vscode` extension and vscode settings is added. based on this project.
- `unwanted packages` and `files` are managed. we can identify which one is not
  used.
- `npm i` to install all `node modules` , `pod` install and check android
  `jetifier`.
- `Multiple Language` Support. `app/translations/locales` add/remove languages
  typescript files. `app/translations/index.ts` declare languages path. and
  Language UI is existing this project.`app/screens/common/language/index.tsx`.
  Just change UI Only.
